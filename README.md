# Multimedia-Retrieval-Scientific-paper-Implementation
This was a project created during my university's course "IMAGE ANALYSIS" <br>
Language: Python<br><br>

In this project, we analysized the following scientific paper and implemented the code using the described method:<br>
"Multimedia Retrieval through Unsupervised Hypergraph-based Manifold Ranking", IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL. 28, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2019. <br><br>

The algorithm described in this article aims to produce a better similarity measure between the images of a database.<br>
This is achieved by utilizing the hypergraph manifold created by the images.
